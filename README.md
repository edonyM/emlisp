Recently I have read a book named ***Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas From The Computer***, recommended by Paul Graham, I want to try Lisp which is forcasted as the future programming language.

Mostly I want to know is what is the mathematical derivation programming language. Andaccording to Paul Graham, Java might go by, Python might go by and Ruby might go by, why Lisp can not?

It is said that Lisp can help to program better.
