## ANSI Common Lisp Cookbook
------
Recently I have read a book named ***Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas From The Computer***, recommended by Paul Graham, I want to try Lisp which is forcasted as the future programming language.

Mostly I want to know is what is the mathematical derivation programming language. And according to Paul Graham, Java might go by, Python might go by and Ruby might go by, why Lisp can not?

It is said that Lisp can help to program better.

***`Personally, I persume the technology and try to answer the questions below.`***
`Unfortunlately Common Lisp is little hard for me, and I was told that you should the method of Lisp and try the dialect called scheme will be better!`

-------

***Strcuture and Interpretation of Computer Programs*** is a helpful book to solve this, so I try the scheme first.
